# hello-world
My First Repository

Hey there people!

I'm new to this coding thing. I am currently part of #CNC2018. So I decided creating a GitHub account would be the best way forward. I have some goals.

1. Why are you learning to code?
I want to start coding because I want to improve my problem solving skills.



2. What’s your goal? I have many goals. To become fluent in at least one coding language. To be able to put together a website. To contribute to the language. To ultimately be able to have a job that utilizes my coding skill, reflected by use of code for a small part of each day.

What’s a tangible learn-to-code goal you hope to reach in 6 months?
To utilize coding daily in my job.

12 months?
To be able to put together a website to reflect my portfolio.


3. What does successful learning look like to you? Visualize and write down what success looks like to you. 
Successful learning will look like having a full GitHub portfolio available, as well as tangible examples of my code hosted on the interwebs. Participating in open source projects at some point.


4. How will you measure that success?
Is it about the amount of time spent, badges collected, courses complete? Are there tools to use to track your learning so that you can measure your progress and document your success?

I would like to code for at least 2 hours per week.
I would like to complete a Python course on codeacademy.
I also plan to use books such as 'Learn Python the Hard Way'
Once I believe I am at a more compentant level, I would like to complete the courses available on MITOpenCourseware or edX.


5. Do you have a timeline, or any deadlines, associated with your learning goals?
Do you need to pass an exam by a certain day? Do you need to start applying for jobs by a certain time? Do want to finish a project on a particular date? Jot down any due dates or important time related criteria. 

I don't have any particular timelines, all I would like is to code for a year.
