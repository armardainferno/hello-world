# hello-world
My First Repository

Hey there people!

I'm new to this coding thing. So I decided creating a GitHub account would be the best way forward. I have some goals.

1. Why are you learning to code?
I want to start coding because I want to improve my problem solving skills.



What’s your goal? I have many goals. To become fluent in at least one coding language. To be able to put together a website. To contribute to the language. To ultimately be able to have a job that utilizes my coding skill, reflected by use of code for a small part of each day.

What’s a tangible learn-to-code goal you hope to reach in 6 months?
To be able to put together a website.

12 months?
To utilize coding daily in my job.


What does successful learning look like to you?
Is it about building a bunch of projects, having a deeper understanding of a particular technology, passing a certification, something else? Visualize and write down what success looks like to you. 
Successful learning will look like having a full GitHub portfolio available, as well as tangible examples of my code hosted on the interwebs.



How will you measure that success?
Is it about the amount of time spent, badges collected, courses complete? Are there tools to use to track your learning so that you can measure your progress and document your success?

???? Need to revisit this.



Do you have a timeline, or any deadlines, associated with your learning goals?
Do you need to pass an exam by a certain day? Do you need to start applying for jobs by a certain time? Do want to finish a project on a particular date? Jot down any due dates or important time related criteria. 

???? Need to revisit this.
