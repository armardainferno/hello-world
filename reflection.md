<b>What is working?</b>

What part of this week’s coding sessions went smoothly? Did you find a learning resource that you enjoy? Is there a place or time of day that’s worked well for you? What feeds your passion and gets you excited to continue coding? Document this part of the process. 
Learning at work is working...


<b>What is not working?</b>

You might have run into some trouble and gotten stuck or frustrated, and that’s ok. It’s also okay if you find some of the work to be boring. What didn’t work for you in your coding sessions this week? What was demotivating or particularly frustrating? Write your thoughts.
Trying to find time outside of me being in front of a computer is not working!


<b>What factors are impacting your learning success?</b>

Schedule: Are you finding that you do better work in the evening after your other obligations are taken care of, or do you do better work in the morning? How about after lunch, or during a coffee break? Track what times you are spending coding, and what seems to be most effective.
Other committments.

Environment: What environment works best for your learning? You may find that you code best where you are most comfortable, such as in your room or even from bed with a laptop. You might be more productive by working from someplace quiet, like a library or study room, or someplace with more background chatter, like a cafe.
My office is the best environment.

Solo or Pair: Have you tried pairing on your learning, or do you work best alone? Are there particular activities that you think you’d do better on a team or with a buddy?
Solo is good for now, Pair might needed in future for harder problems.

<b>What will you do differently next week?</b>

Block out time in my calendar!

I give myself a 4 out of 10 for effort. I have completed 23% of the Codeacademy course so far, which is about 2.5 hrs.
